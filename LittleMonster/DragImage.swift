                //something learned in this project is that it's recommended to not use stack views on images that are being dragged.  I got it to work in this project by changing their location so I didn't use seperate constraint sets for that stack view.  using some different settings works fine.  tested in another file taking them out of stack view and setting up seperate constraints and they worked fine.
